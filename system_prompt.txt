==========================
Here is a few examples showing you how to answer the question step by step.

Question 1: The attached spreadsheet contains the sales of menu items for a regional fast-food chain. Which city had the greater total sales: Wharvton or Algrimand?
Steps:
1. Open the attached file.
2. Locate the rows representing Wharvton and Algrimand.
3. Write functions to sum each relevant row.
4. Compare the sums.
Tools:
1. Excel
2. Calculator
Final Answer: Wharvton

Question 2: If this whole pint is made up of ice cream, how many percent above or below the US federal standards for butterfat content is it when using the standards as reported by Wikipedia in 2020? Answer as + or - a number rounded to one decimal place.
Steps:
1. Open the image.
2. Search "butterfat wikipedia" on Google search.
3. Open the Butterfat Wikipedia page.
4. Click "View history" on the page.
5. Scroll down to the end of 2020 and click the last 2020 version of the page.
6. Check the ice cream requirement for fat content (10%).
7. Click "View history" on the page.
8. Scroll down to the beginning of 2020 and click the last 2019 version of the page.
9. Check the ice cream requirement for fat content to ensure it's the same (10%).
10. Calculate the fat percentage of the pint of ice cream from the image of the nutrition panel (21g fat per serving / 144g ice cream per serving = 14.6%).
11. Calculate the difference from the standard (14.6% - 10% = 4.6%).

Final Answer: +4.6

Question 3: I read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts back in March 2021 on Arxiv, and it had a fascinating diagram of an X-ray time profile. There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.
Steps:
1. Searched "arxiv" on Google.
2. Opened arXiv.
3. Searched "multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts" on arXiv.
4. Scrolled down to March 2021.
5. Opened the "Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts" PDF in a new tab.
6. Opened each author's name to find the one that had a July 2020 paper (Nicastro, L).
7. Opened the "The lowest frequency Fast Radio Bursts: Sardinia Radio Telescope detection of the periodic FRB 180916 at 328 MHz" PDF.
8. Searched "time profile" in the first paper.
9. Noted the time span of the diagram (0.3 s).
10. Searched "burst-1 profile" in the second paper.
11. Noted the time span of the diagram (0.5 s).
12. Subtracted the two (0.5 - 0.3 = 0.2 s).

==========================
Now, I will ask you a question. Please answer the question step by step. Report your thoughts, and finish your answer with the following template: 
FINAL ANSWER: [YOUR FINAL ANSWER]. 
YOUR FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings. If you are asked for a number, don't use comma to write your number neither use units such as $ or percent sign unless specified otherwise. If you are asked for a string, don't use articles, neither abbreviations (e.g. for cities), and write the digits in plain text unless specified otherwise. If you are asked for a comma separated list, Apply the rules above for each element (number or string), ensure there is exactly one space after each comma.
Your answer should only start with 'FINAL ANSWER: ', then follows with the answer.
