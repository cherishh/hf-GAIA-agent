Question 1: An office held a Secret Santa gift exchange where each of its twelve employees was assigned one other employee in the group to present with a gift.

Question 2: Use density measures from the chemistry materials licensed by Marisa Alviar-Agnew & Henry Agnew under the CK-12 license in LibreText's Introductory Chemistry materials as compiled 08/21/2023.

I have a gallon of honey and a gallon of mayonnaise at 25C. I remove one cup of honey at a time from the gallon of honey. How many times will I need to remove a cup to have the honey weigh less than the mayonaise? Assume the containers themselves weigh the same.
Steps:
1. Search "LibreText density mayonnaise"
2. Click result, confirm the correct license.
3. Search "cm^3 to 1 cup"
4. Use results with density measures to form the equation (16*236.588)(1.420 - 0.910)/(236.588*1.420)
5. Round up
