This notebook is used to demonstrate performance of my generic agent. It's tested on the GAIA benchmark.

GAIA is a benchmark designed to evaluate AI assistants on real-world tasks that require a combination of core capabilitiesâ€”such as reasoning, multimodal understanding, web browsing, and proficient tool use.You can find more information on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/en/unit4/what-is-gaia).

This agent currently solves about 30% of GAIA level 1 tasks & Ranked 150 out of 5165 on the [huggingface leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-team/gaia-leaderboard) (as of July 8, 2025).
